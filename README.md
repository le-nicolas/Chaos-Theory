# Chaos;Theory

Its kind of nice that butterfly effect is somehow related to neural net!
By observing how the small initial differences in the Lorenz system's state grow over time, you can appreciate the inherent unpredictability and sensitivity to initial conditions characteristic of chaotic dynamics.

WHILE, Neural networks, especially deep ones, can be sensitive to their initial weights and biases. Small changes in these parameters can lead to different training outcomes and performance on tasks.



BUT!

Techniques like regularization, dropout, and ensemble learning can mitigate the impact of small changes and improve stability.

The analogy to the butterfly effect underscores the importance of careful hyperparameter tuning and model initialization. Automated methods like Bayesian optimization or random search are often used to find good starting points and configurations.

Acknowledging that neural networks can behave chaotically in some respects may lead to better interpretability practices. 



TL;DR- they intersect in the context of sensitivity to initial conditions and the complexity of dynamic systems.
